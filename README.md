This project uses datasets from a Brazilian e-commerce company called Olist, containing information on approximately 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018 across multiple online marketplaces in Brazil. The dataset provides the ability to view each order from multiple dimensions; however, this analysis focuses on selected features for an exploratory data analysis (EDA). Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I visualize key metrics to better understand the platform’s evolution and extract actionable business insights.

Subsequently, I built a sales forecasting model, specifically predicting sales in the first 30 days after a new product launch. This scenario is designed to simulate a real-world business case, and leveraging historical data on existing products — including sales performance and product attributes — to build a regression model that forecasts the expected revenue of new products. Such predictions can help e-commerce platforms and sellers make more informed business decisions when launching new products.
